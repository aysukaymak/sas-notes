/*BENEFITS OF USING SAS MACROS
You write macro programs that generate, compile, and execute SAS code.
This enables you to write code that is easy to modify and can even rewrite itself.

With SAS macro, the system values are automatically substituted into the SAS program each time that it executes.
there's no need for you to manually update the code.
easily replace repetitive values, and submit or modify code based on a condition.
generate repetitive SAS code, changing values with each iteration.
build programs dynamically based on data values.

The macro facility processes the text in a program to generate SAS code. 
This code must still be compiled and executed. 
Therefore, the generated code doesn't run faster than your code, but it can reduce your development and maintenance time as a programmer.

/*SAS PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
SAS includes several programming languages for accessing and manipulating data, performing analysis, and reporting.
	DATA step language is used for data manipulation, 
	SQL procedure is used for data manipulation and reporting, 
	SAS procedures are used for data analysis and reporting. 
Although their syntax may differ, these languages all share a common concept: you write a program in a text editor and submit it to a compiler. 
The program then compiles and executes. It might read, process, and analyze the data, and it might produce output. 
The output might include data tables, reports, or both.

The SAS macro language is different. 
It accesses and manipulates text to generate SAS program code. 
The code produced by SAS macro is submitted to the compiler on your behalf, as if you had written the program yourself. 
You can think of SAS macro as a language used to generate customized SAS code, or even write entire SAS programs for you.

When you write a program that includes macro code, not all of the code is sent to the compiler. 
The SAS code is sent to the compiler and the macro code is sent to the macro processor. 

When you submit a SAS program, it's copied to an area of memory called the input stack. The presence of the text in the input stack triggers a SAS component called a word scanner to begin its work.

The word scanner serves two major functions. 
First, it pulls the raw text from the input stack character by character, left to right, and top to bottom, and transforms it into tokens. 
This process is called tokenization. 
You can think of a token as the original text with an attached metadata tag to help SAS process it. 
The word scanner sends the tokens to another component for processing. 
*/

/*TOKENS
There are four types of tokens: 
	name tokens, 
	number tokens, 
	literal tokens, 
	special tokens.

Name tokens are a string of up to 32 characters, and they must begin with a letter or an underscore, followed by letters, underscores, and digits. 
This category includes keywords, filenames, and column names. 
Note that the rules for name tokens are the same as for valid SAS names.

Number tokens are numeric values. 
They can include digits, a decimal point, a leading sign, and an exponent (in E notation). 
This category also includes SAS date, time, and datetime constants.

Literal tokens are character strings enclosed in single or double quotation marks. 
They can contain any combination of characters up to the maximum length of 32 kilobytes (that is, 32,767 bytes). 
A literal token is treated as a single unit.

A special token is any character that isn't a letter, number, or underscore. 
Special tokens include asterisks, slashes, numeric operators, ampersands, percent signs, and more.

To build a token, the word scanner reads characters until it reaches a delimiter. 
A delimiter is any whitespace character such as a space, tab, or end of line.

	title "Trucks with Horsepower > 250";
	proc print data=sashelp.cars;
    	var Make Model MSRP Horsepower;
    	where Type="Truck" and Horsepower>250;
	run;

Another way that a token ends is when a new token begins. 
When the word scanner reaches a character that doesnâ€™t meet the rules for the current token, it ends the token that it was building and begins building another. 
In the partial statement Horsepower>250, the greater than symbol isn't valid in a name token, so it signals the end of the name token Horsepower. 
The greater than symbol begins a special token, and it ends at the beginning of the number token 250.
